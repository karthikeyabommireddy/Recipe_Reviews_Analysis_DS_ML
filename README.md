# 🍽️ Recipe Reviews Analysis using Data Science & Machine Learning

> A complete end-to-end Data Science project that analyzes recipe reviews using NLP techniques to extract insights and predict sentiment.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing user-written recipe reviews using **Data Science and Machine Learning techniques**.  
The objective is to process raw textual data and extract meaningful insights using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

The notebook demonstrates a real-world NLP pipeline starting from data loading to model evaluation.
